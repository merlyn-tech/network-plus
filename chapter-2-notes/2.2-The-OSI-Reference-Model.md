# **The OSI Reference Model**

Important function of OSI specs is to assist in data transfer between disparate hosts, regardless if they're Unix, Windows, or Mac based.

OSI model is NOT a physical model: it's a conceptual, comprehensive, yet fluid set of guidelines, which app developers utilise to create and implement applications that run on a network.

It provides a framework for creating and implementing networking standards, devices, and interconnecting schemes.

7 Layers:

| **#** | **Layer** | **Upper/Lower** | **Functions** | **Detail** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **7** | **Application** | Upper | File / print / message/ DB / Application services | User Interface. |
| **6** | **Presentation** | Upper | Data encryption / compression / translation services | Presents data, handles processes (e.g. encryption). |
| **5** | **Session** | Upper | Dialog control | Keeps different application's data separate. |
| **4** | **Transport** | Lower | End-to-end connection | Provides reliable (TCP) or unreliable (UDP) delivery.<br>Performs error **correction** before retransmit. |
| **3** | **Network** | Lower | Routing | Provides logical addressing (which routers use for path determination). |
| **2** | **Data Link** | Lower | Framing | Combines packets into bytes, bytes into frames.<br>Provides access to media using MAC addresses.<br>Performs error **detection** not correction. |
| **1** | **Physical** | Lower | Physical Topology | Moves bits between devices.<br>Specifies voltage, wire speed, pin-out of cables. |

**Users interact at Application layer.**  
Upper layers responsible for applications communicating with hosts.
- None of the upper layers knows anything about networking / network addresses. That's the responsibility of the four bottom layers.

**The bottom layers define how data is transferred through physical media, switches and routers.**  
They determine how to rebuild a data stream from a transmitting host, to a destination host's application.

## **Application Layer**

- Where users communicate / interact with the network stack through:
  - application processes
  - interfaces
  - APIs
- that connect the application in use, to the operating system of the computer.

- Chooses and determines the availability of communicating partners, along with resources necessary to make their required connections.
  
- Sometimes computer applications require more than just desktop resources - often uniting communicating components from 1+ network application, e.g.:

    - file transfers
    - email
    - enabling remote access
    - network management activities
    - client server processes.  
    
- Co-ordinates partnering applications, and forms a consensus on procedures for controlling data integrity, and error recovery.
  
- Only used when it's apparent that access to the network is needed.
  
- Acts as an interface between the application program (that is NOT a part of the layered structure) and the next layer down, by providing ways for the application to send information down the protocol stack.

**EXAMPLE:** Take Internet Explorer (IE). You can strip all the networking bits out of it, and still use the UI. But once you need to start opening HTML through HTTP / grabbing a file through FTP, IE does this by attempting to access the Application Layer.

> **IE does NOT reside within the Application layer.**  
> It interfaces with Application Layer protocols when it needs to deal with remote resources.

## **Presentation Layer**

* Presents data to application layer.
  
* Responsible for data translation, code formatting.
  
* EXAMPLE: Data transfer technique is to adapt data into a standard format before transmission. Computers are configured to receive this generically formatted data, and converts it back o native format for reading.
  * EBCDIC to ASCII.


* Ensures data transferred from an application layer of one system can be read by the application layer of another system.
  
* OSI has protocol standards that define how standard data should be formatted.
  
* Tasks:
  
  * Data compression
  * Decompression
  * Encryption
  * Decryption

* all part of this layer.

* Some Presentation layer standards are even involved in multimedia operations.


## **Session Layer**

* Keeps applications' data separate from other applications' data, e.g. multiple web browser sessions on your desktop at the same time.

* Responsible for setting up, managing and tearing down sessions between Presentation layer entities.
* Provides dialog control between devices / nodes.
* Co-ordinates comms between systems
* Serves to organise their comms by offering the following 3 modes.
  - Full duplex
  - Half duplex
  - Simplex

## **Transport Layer**

**Multiplexing:** sending multiple signals or streams of information over a communications link at the same time in the form of a single, complex signal.

* Segments and reassembles data into a data stream.

* Services in Transport Layer handle data from upper-layer applications, and unite it onto the same data stream (multiplexing).

* Provide end-to-end transport services.

* Can establish a logical connection between sending host + destination host on an internetwork.

* Responsible for:

    * Multiplexing upper-layer applications
    * Establishing virtual connections
    * Tearing down virtual circuits

* Hides details of network-dependent info from higher layers, facilitating data transfer.

* TCP/UDP protocols exist in Transport Layer.
  * TCP: Connection-oriented
  * UDP: Connectionless

### Connection-Oriented Communication

- A **virtual circuit** needs to be created in order for the transmitting host to be able to send segments down the model.
- To create this, the sender's TCP process and the destination TCP process need to perform a **handshake**ü§ù.
  - They agree on the amount of info that'll be sent in either direction, the recipient TCP send an acknowledgement.

![TCP Handshake](tcp.webp)

This virtual circuit setup of back and forth messages to create the circuit is called **overhead.**

1. **Synchronisation (SYN):**
   - "Agreement for connection" segment.  
   - Sets what the first sequence number should be for request packets originating from the client.

2. **Synchronisation / Acknowledgement (SYN/ACK):**
   - Sets what the first sequence number should be for response packets originating from the server. 
   - Confirms the request packet sequence number sent by the client by acknowledging it.

3. **Acknowledgement (ACK):**
   - Confirms the response packet sequence number sent by the server by acknowledging it.


Problems:
- Congestion can occur
  - High-speed computer generating lots of data traffic
  - Bunch of computers simultaneously sending datagrams through a single gateway / to destination.
