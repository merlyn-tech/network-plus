# Internetworking Models

**OSI**: Open Systems Interconnection

## **Layered Approach**

**Layers**: When processes required for effective communication divided into logical groupings.

**Layered Architecture**: When a communications system is designed in layers.

**Binding:** If you need to develop a protocol for a certain layer, you only need to focus on that specific layer's functions. The communications processes related to each other are bound at a particular layer.

## Advantages of Reference Models

- OSI Model is **hierarchical.**
- Central purpose of OSI + all networking models is to allow different vendors' networks to interoperate smoothly.
- Divides network comms processes into smaller and simpler components:
  - Helps component development, design, troubleshooting.
- Allows for multi-vendor development through standardisation of network components.
- Encourages industry standardisation:
  - By defining specific functions that occur at each layer of the model.
- Allows various types of network hardware + software to communicate.
- Prevents changes in one layer affecting other layers:
  - Facilitates development
  - Makes application programming much easier.
