# Network+ Chapter 1

###**What is a network?**
- A network is a *group or system of interconnected people or things.*

**LAN**: Local Area Network
**Workgroup**: A set of devices that are physically are in the same network segment. Split LANs into logical zones called "workgroups".

Business Environment: Better to arrange LAN's workgroups along department divisions.

Connect two or more LANs using a *router*.

### **Workstations**

Powerful computeers that run more than one CPU (Central Processing Unit), and who's resources are available to other users on the network to access when needed.

Often systems that end users use on a daily basis.

Not client machines - client machines can be workstations, but not always.
**Client Machine**: Anydevice on the network that can ask for access to resources / other hosts from a server or powerful workstation.

### **Servers**

Run Network OS to maintain and control the network.
Typically highly specialised, and are there  to handle one important labour-intensive job.
It's not tha ta single server can't do many jobs, but you'll get better performance if you dedicate a server to a single task.

Common dedicated servers:

| **Example Server Type** | **Description**                                                                                                             |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **File Server**         | Stores + dispenses files                                                                                                    |
| **Mail Server**         | Handles email functions                                                                                                     |
| **Print Server**        | Manages printers on the network                                                                                             |
| **Web Server**          | Manages web-based activities, by running Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for storing web content and accessing web pages |
| **Fax Server**          | Sends and receives paperless faxes over the network                                                                         |
| **Application Server**  | Manages network applications                                                                                                |
| **Telephony Server**    | Handles call centre, call routing (a sophisticated network answering machine)                                               |
| **Proxy Server**        | Handles tasks in place of other machines on the network, particularly an Internet connection.                               |

### **Hosts**

Typically this term comes up when talking about the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) - means "any network device with an IP address".

### **Wide Area Networks**

Networks designed to span large geographic areas, like the Internet!
Typically employ both router and public links.

WANs vs LANs

WANs:
- Usually need a router port / ports.
- span larger geographic areas.
- are usually slower.
- We can choose when and how long we connect to a WAN. With a LAN, it's all or nothing.
- Can utilise either private / public data transport media e.g. phone lines.

Internet --> Internetwork --> a type of LAN / WAN that connects to a bunch of networks / "intranets".
On an internetwork, you use:
- **Hardware addresses** to communicate with other hosts on the LAN.
- **Logical addresses** to communicate with hosts on other LANs (other side of the router).

Routers make internetworks possible. Each connection into a router is a different logical network.
